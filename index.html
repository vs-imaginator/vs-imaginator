      <h2>Greetings digital traveler,</h2>
      <p>My name is Ernesto Matthew Zamudio, and this is my personal website. I’m a twenty-something with too many hobbies and not enough time. I have a nostalgic appreciation for retro tech, having many fond memories of using my family’s old Windows XP computer, which is where my passion for computer technology began. Some things I enjoy are being a hobbyist website developer, GNU/Linux tinkerer, dabble in programming whenever possible, and have been building computers for nearly a decade. I’m a lifelong learner and enjoy dipping my toes into as many topics as I am able to.</p>
      <p>I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer System Technology at Illinois State University in the spring of ‘21. At university, in tandem with my major, I received a minor in East Asian Studies, with a focus on Japanese language.</p>
      <p>Aside from computer related focuses, I am a self-proclaimed Japanophile and enjoy researching the Japanese language and culture, an interest I’ve held for a number of years. My primary areas of expertise are “Lost Decade” and researching the cultural impact of pop culture. I also fan-translate Japanese manga and song lyrics to further refine my language abilities. Additionally, I’m a book-lover and enjoy writing and researching essays across various blogs in my spare time.</p>
      <p>Everything on this site was programmed by hand in the Atom text editor on my Lenovo Thinkpad x220 running Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
