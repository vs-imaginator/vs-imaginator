      <h2><a name="identity">What is "VS Imaginator?"</a></h2>
      <p><i>Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1</i> is the second entry in a long-running pulp-fiction series “Boogiepop” novels published in Japan by author KADONO Kouhei, published in 1998.
        “Imaginator” is representative of the threat of conformity, which is the major theme of the second and third novels in the series. I am a strong advocate of individualism, because great ideas can only be cultivated within adversity. Those who conform will never have a chance to shine.</p>

      <h2><a name="about">About Ernesto</a></h2>
      <p>In short, Ernesto Matthew Zamudio is a twenty-something year old computer geek. I’m a lifelong learner and enjoy dipping my toes into as many topics as I am able to. Anything from philosophy to programming, I enjoy making little projects for myself whenever possible to learn as much as I can to test my limits. I believe in the open source software movement, advocate for digital privacy and oftentimes find myself thinking about cyberpunk. </p>
      <p>My passion for computer technology began as a result of my nostalgic appreciation for retro tech, having many fond memories of using my family’s old Windows XP computer, where I first interfaced with the web. Consequently, I have enjoyed building various websites following the design philosophies of this era for some time now.</p>
      <p>I build websites from scratch as a hobby, run a media server at home, do some light programming, and tinker with GNU/Linux, my operating system of choice.</p>
      <p>Aside from computer related focuses, I am a self-proclaimed Japanophile and enjoy researching the Japanese language and culture, an interest I’ve held for a number of years. My primary areas of expertise are “Lost Decade” and researching the cultural impact of pop culture. I also fan-translate Japanese manga and song lyrics to further refine my language abilities. I plan on visiting Japan in the near future to put my language skills to the test.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, I am an avid book-lover, enjoy watching foreign films, listening to Japanese rock music and write short essays across various blogs in my spare time. I always carry a book on me instead of fiddling with my phone. Time moves pretty fast, I’d prefer not to waste it!</p>
